# Automobile-Price-Prediction
A project in Python that aims to predict the price of automobiles based on its several specifications and distinctive features. Two regression models were built for the data - Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor and their evaluation metrics are computed. We then visualise the explainability of the model using the SHAP module.

The model is deployed on Streamlit Cloud
