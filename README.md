# Automobile-Price-Prediction
A project in Python that aims to predict the price of automobiles based on its several specifications and distinctive features. Two regression models were built for the data - Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor and their evaluation metrics are computed. We then visualise the explainability of the model using the SHAP module.
